### MTA Builder
 The multi-target application archive builder is a standalone command-line tool that builds a deployment-ready multi-target application (MTA) archive .mtar file from the artifacts of an MTA project according to the projectâ€™s MTA development descriptor (mta.yaml file).
The archive builder is used on a file system independently of the development environment in which the application project has been created. The build process and the resulting MTA archive depend on the target platform on which the archive is deployed.
The currently supported target platforms are SAP Cloud Platform (both the Neo and Cloud Foundry environments) and SAP HANA XS advanced model.
Each module of an MTA project is built using the build technology that is either associated with the module type by default or is configured explicitly. The archive builder is Java-based, currently supported on Windows and Linux.
